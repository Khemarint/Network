Hello Guy In this Code I create an IP address solving problem. It make us easier to do the exercises. 
In the program has a lot of option such as:
1.Convert from Decimal to Binary: In this program option it help us with the leading 0 of the Binary
for me i meet some problem when i convert from decimal to binary in excel it give me the result with no leading 0 
that's why i create this .
2.Convert from Binary to Decimal.
3.Find Subnets and Hosts: In this program Let us find Subnets and Hosts by Enter IP address with slash notaion only
Note : Not for IP address without slash notaion.
4.Find Network Address: In this program let us find Network Address by Enter The first binary of the topic and the second binary of the subnet mask 
and it will give the result of Network Address in decimal and binary .
5.Find BoradCast : In this program let us find BoradCast by Enter the Network Address as binary and the number of Host bit 
we have found from the subnet mask binary example Host = 2^4-2 and the number 4 is Host bit. after that it will give us the result of BroadCast
in decimal and binary.

That's all >.< Thank for Using this program.

I do this program following the instruction of Teacher. I did add a picture in this repositories
which is a example of solving the IP address step by step on excel.

Alert: In the option 4 and 5 if you choose to use that option you can't go back to the menu if you want to go
back you need to debug the code. Sorry for that. but it's fine don't worry guys.
