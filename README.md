Hello, Guy In this Code I created an IP address to solve the problem. It makes it easier to do the exercises. 
The program has a lot of options such as:
1. Convert from Decimal to Binary: This program option helps us with the leading 0 of the Binary
for me I encounter some problem when I convert from decimal to binary in Excel it give me the result with no leading 0 
that's why I created this.
2. Convert from Binary to Decimal.
3. Find Subnets and Hosts: In this program Let us find Subnets and Hosts by Entering IP address with a slash notation only
Note: Not for an IP address without slash notation.
4. Find Network Address: In this program let us find the Network Address by entering the first binary of the topic and the second binary of the subnet mask 
and it will give the result of the Network Address in decimal and binary.
5. Find BoradCast: In this program let us find BoradCast by Entering the Network Address as binary and the number of Host bit 
we have found from the subnet mask binary example Host = 2^4-2 and the number 4 is Host bit. after that, it will give us the result of BroadCast
in decimal and binary.

That's all >.< Thank you for Using this program.

I do this program following the instruction of the Teacher. I did add a picture in this repositories
which is an example of solving the IP address step by step in Excel.

Alert: In options 4 and 5 if you choose to use that option you can't go back to the menu if you want to go
back you need to debug the code. Sorry for that. but it's fine don't worry guys.
