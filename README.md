Hello, Guy In this Code I created an IP address solving problem. It makes us easier to do the exercises. 
The program has a lot of options such as:
1. Convert from Decimal to Binary: This program option helps us with the leading 0 of the Binary
for me I encounter some problem when I convert from decimal to binary in Excel it give me the result with no leading 0 
that's why I created this.
2. Convert from Binary to Decimal.
3. Find Subnets and Hosts: In this program Let us find Subnets and Hosts by Entering IP address with a slash notation only.
Example: 192.168.10.150/28.
Note: Not for an IP address without slash notation.
4. Find Network Address: In this program let us find the Network Address by entering the first binary of the topic and the second binary of the subnet mask 
and it will give the result of the Network Address in decimal and binary.
5. Find Broadcast: In this program let us find BroadCast by Entering the Network Address as binary and the number of Host bit 
we have found from the subnet mask binary example Host = 2^4-2 and the number 4 is Host bit. after that, it will give us the result of BroadCast
in decimal and binary.

That's all >.< Thank you for Using this program.

I do this program following the instruction of my Teacher. I did add a picture in this repositories
which is an example of solving the IP address step by step in Excel.

Updated guy: I added another option which is option 4. Find Number of Subnet bits and Host(IP with Break into network) 
In this option when the topic of exercise is provided the information is only IP and Network without slash notation. 
Example Class B 150.70.20.0 Break into 500 Network.
